/*
    Day 74 coding Statement : 

You have a grid with N rows and M columns. You have two types of tiles — one of dimensions 2×2 and the other of dimensions 1×1. You want to cover the grid using these two types of tiles in such a way that:

Each cell of the grid is covered by exactly one tile; and
The number of 1×1 tiles used is minimized.
Find the minimum number of 1×1 tiles you have to use to fill the grid.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers N,M.
Output Format

For each test case, print on a new line the minimum number of 1×1 tiles needed to fill the grid.

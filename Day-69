/*
    Day 69 coding Statement : Suppose, we have a class A which is the base class and we have a class B which is derived from class A and we have a class C which is derived from class B, we can access the functions of both class A and class B by creating an object for class C.

Hence, this mechanism is called multi-level inheritance. (B inherits A and C inherits B.)

Create a class called Equilateral which inherits from Isosceles and should have a function such that the output is as given below.

Sample Output

I am an equilateral triangle

I am an isosceles triangle I am a triangle
*/

class Isosceles {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("I am an isosceles triangle");
        System.out.println("I am a triangle");
    }
}

 class Equilateral extends Isosceles {
    public void display() {
        super.display(); // call display method of Isosceles class
        System.out.println("I am an equilateral triangle");
    }
}

class Sukumar_Day69 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Equilateral eq = new Equilateral();
        eq.display();
    }
}

/*
    Day 21 coding Statement : Write a program to identify if the number is Palindrome or not

Description

Get a number as input from the user and check whether that number is a Palindrome or not.

Input

121

Output

Palindrome

Input

34

Output

Not a Palindrome

Explantation :
		 The code is a program that asks the user to input an integer and then prints out whether or not it is a palindrome number.
 		 The code is a program that will calculate the sum of an integer number and then print out if it's a palindrome or not.
 		 The code starts by defining the variables to be used in the program.
		 Next, we define a variable called number which will hold the inputted integer value.
		 Then we define another variable called temp_num which will hold the result of adding up all numbers from 1-10 and dividing them by 10.
		 Lastly, we have defined two more variables called sum and rem which are used for calculating each digit in the number.
